The project is to create a game in MIPS assembly language. In the game, which uses the LED display of the MARS simulator, a milipede  moves across a 32x32 screen with 40 one block musrooms that would increase by 1 at a random location every second. When the 10 block long milipede hits a block, it goes down one and starts moving the other direction. The player takes control of a one block person who can fire lasers upwards, and when hitting a mushroom it gets destroyed and when hitting the milipede it gets one block shorter. If the milipede hits the player character, the player loses (and a YOU LOSE! screen pops up), but if the milipede runs out of blocks by being hit by the player, then the player wins (and a YOU WIN! screen pops up).
